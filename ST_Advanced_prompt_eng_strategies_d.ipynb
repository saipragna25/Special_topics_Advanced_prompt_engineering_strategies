It then reads the log file line by line, parses each line as JSON, and if the event type is 'submit' and it was successful, it adds the event id to the 'complete' set and updates the 'last' event.

The `deposit` method adds an amount to the balance, and the `withdraw` method subtracts an amount from the balance. If the amount withdrawn is greater than the balance, the `withdraw` method raises an `InsufficientFunds` exception.\\n\\nThe `SavingsAccount` class inherits from `BankAccount` and adds a new method, `add_interest`. The `add_interest` method calculates the interest on the balance and deposits it into the account. The interest rate is defined as a class attribute, and the `is_high_yield` attribute is used to determine whether the account is a high-yield account. If the account is a high-yield account, the interest is multiplied by 1.1 before being deposited.\\n\\nThe code below creates a `SavingsAccount` object with a balance of $1000 and a high-yield interest rate. It then calls the `add_interest` method to add interest to the account. The `print` statement prints the balance of the account, which is now $1050.\\n\\n```\\naccount = SavingsAccount(\"John Doe\", 1000, is_high_yield=True)\\naccount.add_interest()\\nprint(account.balance)\\n```'"
