            "Coral bleaching is a phenomenon which occurs when coral polyps, the main component of coral reefs, are stressed due to a variety of environmental factors. This stress causes them to expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues, leading to a whitened, or bleached, appearance. The effect of coral bleaching is damaging to the health and survival of coral reefs, and can potentially cause mass die-offs and have far-reaching impacts on coral reef health and connected marine ecosystems.\n",
            "\n",
            "The causes of coral bleaching are fairly numerous, with each causing its own set of impacts. The main cause of coral bleaching is increased water temperatures, which can be caused by natural phenomena such as El Niño Southern Oscillation, or by human-induced climate change. Corals living in waters with temperatures higher than usual for extended periods of time can become stressed and expel their symbiotic algae. Additionally, other physical stressors such as ocean acidification, excessive light or too much sediment can also cause coral bleaching. \n",
            "\n",
            "The effects of coral bleaching can be devastating. Corals stressed from environmental conditions and bleach cannot fuel their metabolism and undergo a process of starvation. When the symbiotic algae are expelled, the coral polyps become weakened and more vulnerable to disease and death. Even slow bleaching with less extensive tissue death can significantly reduce the coral’s ability to produce calcium carbonate, which is essential for realization of coral reef ecosystems. \n",
            "\n",
            "Extensive coral bleaching can and has caused mass die-offs of coral reefs worldwide, with many areas unable to recover. This reduces habitat complexity and filtering potential, often resulting in decreased biodiversity. Corals are often referred to as the ‘rainforests of the sea’, functioning as homes to thousands of other species. Therefore, the decline in coral health and survival can have further cascading impacts throughout the entire ecosystem, from reduced fishery yields to weakened shorelines. \n",
            "\n",
            "Unfortunately, the consequences of global warming due to the human-induced climate change are expected to further exacerbate the issue of coral bleaching. Research and conservation efforts must focus on understanding how corals respond to a rapidly changing environment and finding ways to mitigate the causes of coral bleaching in order to protect and restore these fragile ecosystems.\n"
